            <p>Many reasons to go to gym. Of course exercise is priority. The gym has plenty exercise machines that people can use to develop different muscle groups. Kulas (para. 1) in her article, “The Advantages of Going to the Gym Every Day”, says at
                least 30 minutes of moderate exercise should be done by adults five days in a week so going to the gym everyday will meet that goal. It will result in good physical and mental health. Aside from exercising, one can meet new friends like
                fitness instructors and others. It’s good to be with people with the same interests so that all can motivate each other to keep their fitness goals.</p>
